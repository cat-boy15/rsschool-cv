### About me:

I'm 22 y.o. boy who lives in Vladivostok. I started studying code two weeks ago. Before this stage of my life I was a sailor. I took many prizes and even won world championship in 2011. Then I became a coach. But beeing a coach is about beeing a coach only in summer, because our winters are cold. So I thought beeing a programist is a good idea! 

Long time ago I tried to go to the university but after a year I deducted. 

Now I studying in RS school and trying my best to achive my goal!

I believe that my skill and hardworking will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
