### About me:

I'm 22 y.o. boy who lives in Vladivostok. I started studying code two weeks ago. Before this stage of my life I was a sailor. I took many prizes and even won world championship in 2011. Then I became a coach. But beeing a coach is about beeing a coach only in summer, because our winters are cold. So I thought beeing a programist is a good idea! 

Long time ago I tried to go to the university but after a year I deducted. 

Now a few words about my character and interests. My friends say that I’m not-sociable, honest, helpful and cheerful. But my parents sometimes say that I am not hardworking enough, and that sometimes I am stubborn and hard to deal with, but I don’t think I am. I often lose my temper but never have a grudge against anybody. My favourite occupation is playing computer games, walking and going to the cinema. I am fond of sport as well as you remember.That’s all I can say about myself.

Now I studying in RS school and trying my best to achive my goal!

I believe that my skill and hardworking will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
